# spook-fighters
A repository for the development of the free open-source game Spook Fighters. This is a hobby project, and is currently under volatile development.

# playing
If you wish to play Spook Fighters, simply download the main.exe file from dist and run it.

Alternatively, to natively run the game, you need Python 3.7+ and Pygame 1.9+ (older versions may or may not work). Clone the repo and then run the main.py file and it should start.

If you have never used Python before, simply install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/ and then open command prompt and run 'pip install pygame'.
