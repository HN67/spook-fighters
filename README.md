Possible Mechanic Designs:

	a) Classic (Spook Fighter X):
	
		-Standard HP (Hits deal damage, upon reaching 0 health, you lose)
		
		-Basic attack
		
		-3 Special Attacks with cooldown
		
	b) Brawlhalla / Smash Bros
	
		-Percentage Damage, more damage taken increases knockback
		
		-Death by being knocked out of arena
		
		-Basic attack and heavy attack that change based on direction
		
	c) New Option 1
	
		-HP, but top part of HP (e.g. 30%) regenerates fairly quickly after not taking damage for a while
		
		-Middle hp (e.g.  middle 50%) regenerates slowly out of combat
		
		-Bottom HP (e.g. bottom 20%) does not regenerate naturally
		
		-Standard Attack (Offensive oriented)
		
		-Shield Attack (Smaller range, damage taken while shield attack active is directed to shield health instead)
		
		-Shield Health (Regenerates extremly fast once out of combat, but only absorbs damage while shield attack is active)
		
		-Ultimate attack (Strong offensive and actives shield), has cooldown (may be signifigant)
