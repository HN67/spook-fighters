Variables:
	xSpeed
	ySpeed
	jumps
	force
	gravity
	friction
Game Loop:
	if right-key-pressed:
		increase xSpeed by force
	if left-key-pressed:
		decreases xSpeed by force
	Running Mechanics:
		Realistically, what stops you from infinitly accelerating is that you loose most of your speed upon
		hitting the ground, so your speed is determined by pushoffs a second * force of the pushoff. However,
		you have to accelerate because you cannot cycle your legs as fast, but once in the air you can cycle the
		leg in the air so it is ready for when you land?
	--decrease xSpeed magnitude by floor(xSpeed / 10) [+/*] friction??
